		<h3>About me</h3>
	
		<p>I’m passionate about helping companies grow their business particularly in emerging industries and industries undergoing a transformation. Over the last few years, I’ve enjoyed helping technology and media companies in Europe and the US enter their next stage of growth by advising them on strategic and financial transactions. During this time, I’ve worked with fascinating companies involved in a variety of technologies: internet, payments, e-commerce, software, semiconductors, advertising and gaming. </p>
	
		<p>My experience in working at several outstanding professional organizations has also focused on developing and scaling new business units. I was a member of a founding technology investment banking team in Europe and the founding transaction structuring team at a Big Four accounting firm. During this time, I’ve enjoyed helping to develop the strategy and also building the practices to scale.</p>
	
		<p>To date, I have spent my career working in London, San Francisco, Chicago and New York and have managed to build a valuable and diverse network of contacts across a variety of sectors.</p>
 	
	 	<p>Outside of work, I also currently serve as the UK Alumni President for the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>
